/**
 * Never in your life now make notes for competitive programming solutions,
 * whatever you already have is fine but not now
 *
 * Best way to learn competitive programming is learning question, understanding it, writing on a paper and trying to solve in that way first
 * looking for discussions, looking for constraints and taking care of edge cases accordingly. so all this stuffs you can never find in
 * notes of code and questions, specially in your leetcode notes also.
 *
 * So if you have anything to add in any problem. Now onwards we will be adding here in this repo only related to problems, solutions,
 * anything new learning and DSA learning all can be kept here and can be accessed from everywhere
 *
 * You can also add those pdfs here, or share the link from drive stuff things.
 *
 * Probably slowly we are going to remove written notes and put all here. Either in code form with better and progressing expalanation
 * or those best pages in form of PDF or CamScanner.
