# Don't be too dependent on notes, better be dependent upon your approach and ability to write that approach in code
## In this way only you can learn in long run. Destroy notes in long run, it will make you very dependent on it, 
## without you knowing the approach and your ability to write the code on your own.
### if something very new things also comes up then make temporary note and then write in here. in approach and code to revise
#### notes only dullying our mind
