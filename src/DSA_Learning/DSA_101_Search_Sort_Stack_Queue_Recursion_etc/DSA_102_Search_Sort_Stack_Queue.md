# Here we will include topics for Search, Sort, Stack and Queues



#### Search algorithm
* 1. Linear search (simple search)
* 2. binary search (It is done here in non-recursive manner check in code)




#### Sorting Algorithm
* 1. Merge Sort : 
* Approach : divide the array recursively, and then merge the divided sub-arrays in sorted manner in main array again. this is the approach. code implemented and well 
* explained, check in code





#### Stack and Queue
* No need to do implementation code, as that is easy now
* Learn interview related questions on this like 
* 1. Implement stack using 2 queue and implement queue using two stack and other questions in this data structure

* Remember notes are not important, you need to know the approach and able to code is only way to clear coding round
