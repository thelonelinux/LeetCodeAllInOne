# Graph Learning


## Graph Learning Process
* Basic starts from representing the graph and then it's two main traversal viz BFS and DFS, 
* After that you solve as many questions you can using this graph representation and traversal


### Graph important learning links, (more important is you should be able to understand approach and then write code and explain)
* https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph
* Don't make note of these things and no need to take printout
* just learn the approach, write the code as per your understanding and explaining way. first you can see in youtube, then write approach and then code thing
* In here only you can find link for exploring other DSA topics like linkedlist, tree etc.


#### Solve as many as problem in Graph Competitive Programming to understand it's working and get ready with competitive programming



#### Graph self notes pdf provided here only contain the basic level graph implementation and traversal way of bfs and dfs
