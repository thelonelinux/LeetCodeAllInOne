# There is a process to approach
## You must following things in step wise as goes in company's


#### Steps to learns things
* 1. First step, is always coding round, mostly questions are easy, medium and hard. So first master coding and problem solving skill
* 2. Second step, Interview round : can be DSA related or there requirement related like Fullstack dotnet or java full stack, then they will ask questions related to projects done this stack
* 3. SQL, DBMS, OS (This has been rarely asked for some time now as per my interview experience), So for now hold on this. though if your current project include this then must learn about SQL, DBMS
* 4. HLD/ LLD, Design Pattern, we have never come to this round yet
* 5. Managerial round : Basics (Will discuss later, not gone till this round for some time)


##### Learning Strategy
* From above conclusion, do more leetcode coding and improve problem solving skills, and also do competitive programming in codeforces, codechef, and Leetcodes and other platforms if anymore
* DP, Trees and Graphs questions collect and do more understanding and later write code on your own like explaining someone, as we did in DP.


##### Extra Learning and growth
* Look for freelancing to improve your overall skills like in java and dotnet
* Also learn about Devops, AWS, Azure as they are more in demand
* CAT aptitude and English things you know can also be helpful later
